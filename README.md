Mobile communication
	Mobile phone 
	A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone and a hand phone) is a device that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link whilst moving around a wide geographic area. It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.
	
	In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.

Use of mobile phones
	Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, including keeping in touch with family members, conducting business, and having access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people carry more than one cell phone for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may also be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans—a particular plan might provide cheaper local calls, long-distance calls, international calls, or roaming. The mobile phone has also been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society, for example:
		A study by Motorola found that one in ten cell phone subscribers have a second phone that often is kept secret from other family members. These phones may be used to 			engage in activities including extramarital affairs or clandestine business dealings. 
		Some organizations assist victims of domestic violence by providing mobile phones for use in emergencies. They are often refurbished phones. 
		The advent of widespread text messaging has resulted in the cell phone novel; the first literary genre to emerge from the cellular age via text messaging to a website 			that collects the novels as a whole.[34]
		Mobile telephony also facilitates activism and public journalism being explored by Reuters and Yahoo! and small independent news companies such as Jasmine News in Sri 			Lanka.
		The United Nations reported that mobile phones have spread faster than any other technology and can improve the livelihood of the poorest people in developing countries 		 by providing access to information in places where landlines or the Internet are not available, especially in the least developed countries. Use of mobile phones also 			spawns a wealth of micro-enterprises, by providing work, such as selling airtime on the streets and repairing or refurbishing handsets.[36]
		In Mali and other African countries, people travel from village to village to let friends and relatives know about weddings, births and other events, which is avoided if 		  the villages are within mobile phone coverage areas. In many African countries, mobile phone coverage is greater than land line penetration, so most people own a mobile 			phone. In the smaller villages without electricity, phones are recharged using a solar panel or motorcycle battery. 
		The TV industry has recently started using mobile phones to drive live TV viewing through mobile apps, advertising, social tv, and mobile TV. 86% of Americans use their 			mobile phone while watching TV.
		In parts of the world, mobile phone sharing is common. It is prevalent in urban India, as families and groups of friends often share one or more mobiles among their 			members. There are obvious economic benefits, but often familial customs and traditional gender roles play a part.[39] For example, in Burkina Faso, it is not uncommon 		for a village to have access to only one mobile phone. The phone is typically owned by a person who is not natively from the village, such as a teacher or missionary, 			but it is expected that other members of the village are allowed to use the cell phone to make necessary calls.
