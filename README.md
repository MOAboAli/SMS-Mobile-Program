Send SMS from your PC

Any mobile phone is able to send short messages in the GSM network. However, to use this facility in a personal computer, the mobile phone must be connected with it. There is a standard for serial connection between the modem and the PC, which is also applicable for the GSM device (GSM modem).

First mobile devices were connected to the computers via cable (a real serial connection). Nowadays only pluggable GSM modems use real serial port to communicate with the computer, whereas ordinary mobile phones use Bluetooth connection (they use one of the Bluetooth services, the so-called virtual serial connection).

The AT communication protocol is a simple terminal protocol. It means that sending SMS by direct using the AT communication protocol consists of typing several text commands in a terminal window, which is obviously not an user-friendly interface. Headwind GSM modem driver is the application implementing this interface and providing a user-friendly GUI for sending messages from the PC.
