Mobile communication
Mobile phone 
A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone and a hand phone) is a device that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link whilst moving around a wide geographic area. It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, allowing access to the public telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single, private base station.
	
In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.

Send SMS from your PC

Any mobile phone is able to send short messages in the GSM network. However, to use this facility in a personal computer, the mobile phone must be connected with it. There is a standard for serial connection between the modem and the PC, which is also applicable for the GSM device (GSM modem).

First mobile devices were connected to the computers via cable (a real serial connection). Nowadays only pluggable GSM modems use real serial port to communicate with the computer, whereas ordinary mobile phones use Bluetooth connection (they use one of the Bluetooth services, the so-called virtual serial connection).

The AT communication protocol is a simple terminal protocol. It means that sending SMS by direct using the AT communication protocol consists of typing several text commands in a terminal window, which is obviously not an user-friendly interface. Headwind GSM modem driver is the application implementing this interface and providing a user-friendly GUI for sending messages from the PC.
